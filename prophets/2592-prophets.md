That’s the final number of prophets that have arrived at Babylon and have survived the great burn ❤️‍🔥

5,503 common prophets have perished 🪦☠️

**🛡️2,592 surviving prophets, we march onwards.**

> For honor’s sake, for duty’s sake, for glory’s sake, we march, into hell’s mouth we march…

It’s our job to onboard, evangelize and share Babylon with the rest of the internet. We are here because we believe **crypto is the biggest opportunity that we have seen in our lifetimes** and we want to invite others to join us to create generational wealth by investing in DeFi together.

Today, a **new era begins for Babylon Finance**.

## Arrival Aftermath <a href="#ce04" id="ce04"></a>

First of all, let’s recap the results of the event related to the goals we set in the [original post](https://medium.com/babylon-finance/the-prophets-of-babylon-nfts-4dea318dc729).

* 🏛️ Raise money for the treasury. We have raised **+700ETH for Babylon’s treasury, or \~$3.1M in exchange for \~1.4% of the network.**
* 💰 **Provide Liquidity for BABL**. The treasury has secured enough capital to bootstrap liquidity for BABL, the governance token behind Babylon. Our friends at 🚜 Harvest have already submitted a proposal to create a **Uniswap V3 Pool + Harvest Vault**. You can see [more information here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1d3ZCVrvekktGhbiPLMNzw\_1n8-12iYerm5GI2XAN\_MY/edit).
* ⚔️ **Call to arms**. One of our goals was to spread the word of Babylon and onboard new people into the protocol. Since we announced the event, our Discord server has increased more than **60%, from 8k to 13k** and our email list increase **50% from 16k to 24k**. Our protocol TVL has also seen an influx of new users and deposits, and even with the recent market downturn, we have **grown from $11M to $15M in TVL**.
* ⛺ **Reward Early Settlers.** It’s really important for Babylon to reward the participants that have been with us since the beginning. Early settlers have been rewarded and were able to mint a prophet for free. Thank you for all your support🙏🏿

The arrival has been an energy-intensive and time-consuming process.

Thanks to you, [2,422 Prophets](https://babylon.finance/prophets/gallery), we have emerged on the other side with the funds needed to grow Babylon together.

## The Now <a href="#3ee3" id="3ee3"></a>

Here are the immediate steps that we are taking as a community:

* If you are a prophet holder, you have immediate access to the beta and can **start depositing into** [**Babylon Gardens**](https://babylon.finance/portfolio) 🌴 immediately. Remember that we are in the first and highest quarter of mining rewards, where 53k BABL are distributed. [Learn more](https://docs.babylon.finance/babl/mining)
* Starting tomorrow, **November 20th at 8 am PST**, all the prophet holders — that are not US residents — will be able to 🎒**claim their BABL tokens** by visiting the [Prophets site](https://www.babylon.finance/prophets). Remember to check our gallery before buying a prophet on Opensea or any other secondary market. Our gallery is the only page to check if the BABL loot has been claimed.
* From Wednesday 24th at 8 am PST, you will be able to **stake your prophet** into a garden 🌴 and **receive extra mining rewards**. You can only stake one prophet per garden.
* If the [BIP-4 proposal is approved](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d3ZCVrvekktGhbiPLMNzw\_1n8-12iYerm5GI2XAN\_MY/edit), you can expect BABL to be listed on Uniswap by November 28th. The proposal will also create a BABL vault on 🚜 Harvest so LPs can stake their tokens and receive **additional BABL.**
* At the beginning of December, we’ll add functionality in our gardens so they can take LP positions on the BABL pool, stake the LP tokens and compound the rewards.

## 🗡️ Onward <a href="#4225" id="4225"></a>

**We are a small community but a strong one**. 50 engaged wise prophets that love Babylon are more powerful than 100,000 weak hands.

In order to reward 💪 strong Babylonians, we’ll award **2 extra BABL** to every user that stakes a prophet in a garden before December 7th and keeps the prophet staked until our planned public launch (expected for mid January 2022).

**Remember why we are here**. We are here to remove intermediaries, increase financial access and give everyone a chance to build wealth and share it with others.

> The world will know that free men stood against a tyrant, that few stood against many…
