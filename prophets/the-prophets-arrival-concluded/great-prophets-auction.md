# Great Prophets Auction

## When

From: Monday, Nov 15th 2021 at 8:00 am PST.

To: Friday, Nov 19th 2021 at 4:00pm PST.

## Auction Summary

The 1,000 great prophets are auctioned. The Great Prophets are sorted by their value. The auction will collect bits until the auction ends.  **The top 1,000 bids will receive the great prophets**.

* In order to **maximize price discovery**, the great prophets will be auction-based. They don’t have a per-person limit.
* To avoid **gas wars**, the great prophets sale will use an off-chain auction. Signatures will be used to represent and store the user bids.

We’ll use a [Vickrey auction](http://timroughgarden.org/f13/l/l2.pdf). A second-price or Vickrey auction is a **sealed-bid auction** in which the highest bidder wins and pays a price equal to the second-highest bid.&#x20;

You only pay enough to beat the second person, which provides strong performance guarantees and promotes people to truthfully bid their value.

In simpler terms:

* The 1,000 great prophets will be sorted by their floor price.
* You cannot see other people's bids until the auction has ended.
* Every person can submit **multiple bids**. You cannot see what amount other people bid.
* A bid needs to be above the floor price of a great prophet to qualify for it.
* A specific bid qualifies you for all the great prophets whose floor price is below your bid.
* Once the event ends, all bids will be disclosed. The **top 1,000 bids will receive the 1,000 great prophets**\*
