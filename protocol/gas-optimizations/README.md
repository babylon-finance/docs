# Gas Optimizations

At Babylon.finance, our core mission is to help people accumulate wealth through **community-led funds on DeFi**.

We believe crypto is a new asset class that will overperform any other asset during the next two decades. Therefore we believe that **DeFi needs to be more accessible** so more people can have the opportunity to create wealth.

As the price of ETH and ETH gas costs have increased, **many people have been priced out of DeFi**.

We have been working hard to offer several gas benefits to our users:

* First of all, Gardens allow members to **share the execution costs** of a strategy. For example, if you have a garden with a strategy to buy the token UNI and there are a hundred members, you only need to execute one swap instead of one hundred.
* Secondly, we developed some wizardry to allow you to [**deposit in gardens via signature**](gasless-deposits.md). Signature deposits reduce gas costs by 60% and the best part is that you don't even need ETH.
* Thirdly, the strategist can set a **max gas fee % per strategy**. The keeper will only execute and finalize strategies when it is capital efficient to do so.
* Finally,  gardens and the treasury of the protocol are subsidizing deposits. If you deposit when the gas price is below 125 gwei, your **deposit will be free**. If the gas price is below 500 gwei, you will get a 25-50% discount on the deposit.
