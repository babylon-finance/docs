# Integrations

Each Garden will be able to choose where to deploy their capital and which protocols to use. We hope to enable visionary Strategists by providing a rich set of integrations and balanced incentives for both Strategists and LPs. We see the space as a **positive-sum game** and itâ€™s our goal to provide as much liquidity to the ecosystem as we can.
