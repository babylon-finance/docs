Almost two months ago, we released ü´Ä [The Heart of Babylon](https://medium.com/babylon-finance/the-heart-of-babylon-defi-3-0-6d16e35817f2) a supercharged staking mechanic for BABL holders combining +10 token mechanics from the best of DeFi.

The Heart has already generated 27% extra BABL for stakers, averaging **160% APR.** It is not a surprise that the capacity was reached quickly and it had to be increased twice through [governance proposals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12dx7CtJDZBmSKnF\_07SklE1iMhj5njXmwEuAy5KFnNA/edit#heading=h.2lbbnnssblwx).

Today, we are excited to **introduce the Bond program**, so Babylonians can receive extra discounts on BABL staking ‚Äî up to 10% ‚Äî for giving the protocol assets that Babylon needs.

## üìñ A brief note about bonding <a href="#596c" id="596c"></a>

According to Investopedia, a bond is a [fixed-income instrument](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp) that represents a loan for a specific duration made by an investor to a borrower. In the simplest case, upon maturity, the depositor receives the principal.

[Olympus](https://medium.com/babylon-finance/the-heart-of-babylon-defi-3-0-6d16e35817f2) (OHM) popularized the concept in DeFi to allow the protocol to accumulate _Protocol Controlled Liquidity_ (PCV) in exchange for discounts to the bonder.

In Babylon, the protocol wants to acquire the following assets:

* ü¶Ñ **BABL-ETH Uniswap V3 LP tokens**. We want to substantitally increase the liquidity of our pair to provide more depth for traders and prevent liquidation cascades i.e [MEV incident](https://medium.com/babylon-finance/the-mev-doom-loop-f0c0d5c9523b) ü§ñ.
* ü§ù [Babylon Gold Lender Fuse Pool LP tokens](https://medium.com/babylon-finance/babylon-lending-markets-e0aee652e8c2). We created **lending and borrowing markets** to allow Babylonians and Gardens to use BABL as collateral. We need to increase the liquidity to expand our support to partners.

## ü•á How to bond BABL-ETH ‚Äî 5% Discount <a href="#1957" id="1957"></a>

ü¶Ñ Our [BABL-ETH](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xe2de090153403b0f0401142d5394da897630dcb7) pair on Uniswap has now more than $1M in liquidity. Our goal is to increase this number to +$2M in the next 6 months.
