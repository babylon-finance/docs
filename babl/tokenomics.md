# Tokenomics

The $BABL token is the governance token for the Babylon protocol. It ensures that **Babylon is owned by its users.**&#x20;

**69% of $BABL tokens belong to the community,** dynamically rewarding stakeholders for investing, generating ideas, curating plays, and managing communities based on a communityâ€™s performance and AUM.

The protocol goal is to have the best investment communities in the digital asset class. The protocol is designed to ensure that all the participants are aligned in their individual motivations to achieve this common goal.
