# Babylon Governor

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

[Babylon Governor](https://medium.com/babylon-finance/introducing-babylon-governor-6d9e45d7ca3c) enables anyone who holds **$BABL**, Babylon’s governance token, to submit proposals and **vote on protocol-level decisions, beginning with treasury management.**

The treasury receives 5% of profits and 0.5% of capital allocated through Babylon. 69% of the total supply of $BABL is reserved for the community and we expect the first governance proposals to be submitted in the coming weeks to allocate treasury capital to the benefit of the protocol and its users.

Babylon Governor marks the first mainnet deployment of [Open Zeppelin’s Governor](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/governor-smart-contract/). The contract is compatible with Governor Alpha and Bravo, and we are using [Tally](https://www.withtally.com/) to provide a simple user interface to delegate votes, create proposals, and cast votes on proposals.
