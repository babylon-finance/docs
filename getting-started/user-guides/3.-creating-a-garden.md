# 3. Creating a Garden:

Once you have a Web3 wallet installed on your browser you can start exploring different gardens. If none of the existing gardens appeal to you, you are free to create your own. This guide will help you navigate the Dapp and get started building your own investment club with Babylon.

**Step 1:** When you hit the landing page of Babylon you will need to launch the application with the button at the top right of the page.&#x20;

**Step 2:** After launching the application, press the same button again, which this time prompts you to connect your wallet.&#x20;

**Step 3:** Select Metamask and a pop-up will prompt you to select an account you want to connect to Babylon with. Select the account you funded in [User Guide 1. Funding a Web3 Wallet.](1.-funding-a-web3-wallet.md)&#x20;

![Step 3](<../../.gitbook/assets/Connect Metamask.png>)

**Step 4:** Go to the "Explore" tab at the top, or scroll to the bottom of the page to find the "Create your own" button.

![Step 4](<../../.gitbook/assets/Step 4.png>)

**Step 5:** Closely review the highlighted features gardens offer to their creators and members, then click the "Begin Setup" button.&#x20;

**Step 6:** Customize your garden name, reserve asset, description/thesis & the starting vanity NFT to represent your garden and click "Next." In our example we will use WETH as our reserve asset.

**Step 7:** On the "Deposits & Redemptions" page you will be able to customize how assets are deposited or redeemed within the fund. Most of these parameters are safeties in place to avoid share price manipulation. When you are ready, click "Next."

**Step 8:** On the "Access Control" page you can customize how profits are divided as well as determine who can join, vote, or propose strategies in your garden. We will continue using default parameters, but feel free to adjust these to your specific needs. Click "Next" when you are finished.&#x20;

**Step 9:** The "Capital & Duration" page will go over strategy parameters including minimum and maximum strategy durations, votes required to implement strategies, and risk preferences related to liquidity. When you are satisfied with your parameters, click "Next."

**Step 10:** Carefully review all of your parameters and settings. When you are satisfied, read and agree to the Terms and Conditions and press the "Approval Required" button at the bottom of the page.

{% hint style="info" %}
Babylon is non-custodial and does not have access to your funds; however, it will need your permission to deposit funds into a garden. If you only have ETH in your Web3 wallet, check out [Steps 6-9 in "User Guides: 2. Joining a Garden"](2.-joining-a-garden.md) or simply [follow this link to Matcha.xyz](https://matcha.xyz/markets/1/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2/0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee) where you can wrap your ETH into WETH.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

![Step 10](<../../.gitbook/assets/Step 10.png>)

**Step 11:** After pressing the approval button, a metamask pop-up will appear asking if you want to give babylon.finance permission to spend your WETH. This is required in order to deposit into gardens as well as create new ones. Confirm the transaction in Metamask and wait for it to be confirmed by the blockchain.

![Step 11](<../../.gitbook/assets/Step 11.png>)

![Step 11](<../../.gitbook/assets/Step 11.5 (1).png>)

**Step 12:** Now that you have given Babylon permission to create your garden, all that's left is to press the Create a Garden button! Follow the Metamask prompts and wait for your transaction to be confirmed, and viola! You're garden is ready for your community.&#x20;
