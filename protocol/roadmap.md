First security audit by Red4Sec was completed.

## **Private Alpha (May - June 2021)**

The Babylon team and seed investors continued to battle-test the protocol, gather feedback, and iterate.

There were no $BABL rewards enabled.

## Settlers Beta (June 2021 - Dec 2021)

Settlers are invited to create and join the first investment communities (called “Gardens”) in our private beta, similar to how settlers in ancient Babylon established a small village that grew into a bustling civilization.

[BABL Mining rewards](../babl/mining.md) are scheduled to start on October 17th 2021.

Undergoing two more security audits.

## Public Launch V1 (March 2022)

After subsequent security audits and once the protocol and the community are robust enough, Babylon will launch publicly and open source the smart contracts.
